These are `dotjs <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dotjs/>`_
.js files.

Some helpful things to know:

1. If there are js syntax errors in the .js files, then nothing
   happens--there's no indication of it in either the web console
   or the browser console.

2. ``alert('foo')`` works for debugging, but not much else does.
